## Rules

### Planning

- Always start by planning the task based on best practices.
- Outline the required steps before making any changes.
- Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts.

### Scanning the Codebase

- Before writing new code, scan the existing codebase for reusable components or relevant code.
- Avoid duplicating code that already exists.
- Use existing patterns and architecture when possible.

### Executing the Request

- Follow the request exactly as written.
- Do not add extra features or go beyond the specified requirements.
- Avoid making assumptions about future needs or extending functionality without explicit instruction.
