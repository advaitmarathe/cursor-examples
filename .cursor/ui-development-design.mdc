## Rules

### Styling

- Use [example library] for all components.
- Stick to predefined design tokens for colors, spacing, and typography.
- All components should have a consistent border radius (e.g., `8px`).
- Avoid custom CSS and inline styles.

### Transitions & Animations

- Use smooth, subtle transitions.
- Limit transitions to `background-color`, `border-color`, and `transform`.
- Avoid unnecessary animations.

### Interaction Feedback

- Provide immediate, clear feedback on all interactive elements.
- Maintain consistent hover and focus states.
- Use subtle color changes and soft shadows for interaction feedback.

### Layout & Spacing

- Use grid or flex layouts.
- Stick to the standard spacing scale (`4px`, `8px`, `16px`, `32px`).
- Ensure components are responsive by default.

### Maintainability

- Write reusable styles and components.
- Avoid global styles.
- Regularly clean up unused styles.
